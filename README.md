# MJML Mailer

## About

This package was built with the purpose of serving as a quick means of proof testing email templates built with the MJML framework. Images should be PNG. It connects to a supabase API for hosting, where it will host the whole template like:

yourTemplate/ \n
├─ index.mjml/ \n
├─ index.html/ \n
├─ img/ \n
│ ├─ imageName.png \n
│ ├─ imageName.png \n
│ ├─ ...

It will only export templates with that folder structure and file names. Anything else will not work. Also, images src URLs on the mjml file must be local paths e.g. './img/imageName.png'. If they are different, the parser will not be able to replace local URLs with signed URLs generated by supabase.

## Commands

### login <id> <password>

The package uses Nodemailer to send mails. To that end, it needs valid credentials to work. For now, it only works with Gmail. If your gmail account uses 2FA, you will need to generate a app password on your security settings.

### bucket -c/-d/-l \[name]

Creates or deletes a bucket or lists all buckets on supabase. Each bucket acts as a folder where each email template is stored. Bucket names should be easy to remember and relate to the template.

### export <name> \[path]

Exports a template's .mjml and .png files to a bucket. Path is optional on Windows only.

### prepare <name>

Replaces all image URLs from local to remote paths with temporary URLs generated by supabase, and then parses MJML into HTML ready for mailing.

### mail <name> <recipients>

Sends the template on a bucket to all recipients. Recipient list should be surrounded by quotation marks and separated by commas e.g. ', '.
